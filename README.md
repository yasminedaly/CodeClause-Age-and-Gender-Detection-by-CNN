# CodeClause-Age-and-Gender-Detection-by-CNN

Age, Ethnicity and Gender detection project using CNN on Jupyter notebook as part of the CodeClause internship. The project involved several key steps, including:

Importing essential libraries: I began by importing the necessary libraries, such as numpy, pandas, keras, and matplotlib, to perform data analysis, visualization, and building the neural networks.

Analyzing and cleaning the data: I then analyzed and cleaned the data to ensure it was in the right format and ready for further processing.

Data distribution with visualization: I used visualization techniques to understand the distribution of data, which helped in shaping the data for the model.

Reshape data: I reshaped the data to meet the model’s requirements.

Image Overview: I performed an image overview, which helped in understanding the image size, and channels, which were further used in the model.

Building Neural Networks for AGE, GENDER AND ETHNICITY: I built neural networks for age, gender, and ethnicity, using the CNN architecture.

Categorizing target values: I categorized target values for age, gender and ethnicity, which helped in the model’s prediction.

Normalize the data: I normalized the data to improve the model’s performance.

Image Data Generator: I used Image Data Generator to perform data augmentation and to avoid overfitting.

Train Test Split: I split the data into train and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Building CNN Model: I built the CNN model, which was used for age, gender, and ethnicity predictions.

Ethnicity Prediction: I performed ethnicity predictions using the model, which were further plotted to understand the model's performance.

Plotting model performance: I plotted the model's performance to understand the model's accuracy and loss.

Measuring Loss & Accuracy: I measured the loss and accuracy of the model for age, gender and ethnicity predictions.
